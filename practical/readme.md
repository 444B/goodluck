Introducttion:
In this section you will have to put into practice some of the things we have been learning over the last few weeks. 
Some of the lessons are obvious such as command line and Linux.
Some of the lessons are not so obvious such as learning how to find answers, never giving up and discovering this massive world of computers and cybersecurity

Setup:
- You will need to be connected to a Local Area Network such as Wifi that has the Target machine. The Target machine in this case is a CentOS Server running on 444B's computer via Virtualbox.
- You will need to be running a distribution of Linux that you are familiar with. The following protocols will be used and you may need to be familiar with your distro's package manager if you lack any of the software for specific commands. The commands you may need to download are:
- - Ftp
- - SSH
- - GIT (if you need it)
